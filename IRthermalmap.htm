          Aerial thermal mapping of your facility, complex, campus, military 
          base or city every few years will reveal leaks in all types of 
          systems, like <a href="IRsteamsurvey.htm">steam and condensate return lines</a>, 
          <a href="IRliquidleaksurvey.htm">hot water lines, 
          chilled water lines, supply water mains, distribution pipes, storm 
          water drains</a>, <a href="IRroofleaksurvey.htm">building heat loss and moisture leaks into your roofs</a>. 
          Aerial photographs should be taken every few years as well. They are 
          inexpensive and can be a great asset when discussing future building 
          additions with management, planning utility repairs and improvements, 
          drawing CADs of the facilities and for uses as simple and handy as 
          'showing' outside contractors where not to park. <br>
          <br>
          The methodology for taking infrared (IR) thermographs is similar in 
          many ways to taking aerial photographs. To collect the data, the 
          aircraft flies over a given area with a camera mounted to the airframe 
          and oriented looking straight-down (NADIR) to the ground. Oblique or 
          lower angle shots are taken out the side of the aircraft by pointing 
          the camera at the desired angle. The imagery is stored on film or a 
          computer hard drive and later copied it to a convenient deliverable, 
          such as a DVD. Obviously, aerial photos are taken during the day 
          because the sun provides brilliant visible light so one can see 
          features on the ground, like buildings, bridges, roads, etc.<br>
          <br>
          Where aerial infrared thermography differs from aerial visible 
          photography is the time of day when the survey occurs and the 
          wavelength of the imagery that the detector collects. IR thermography 
          of ground objects is performed at night because the sun and its 
          effects on objects is a tremendous distraction in the imagery. 
          Thermography reveals sources of heat and the relative differences in 
          heat from one object to another. Infrared imagery is a grayscale 
          picture whose scales (or shades of gray) represent the differences in 
          temperature and emissivity of objects in the image. Objects in the 
          image that are lighter in color are warmer and darker objects are 
          cooler. No object in an IR image is detected via visible light 
          wavelengths (400-700 nanometers) rather, only from thermal infrared 
          wavelengths in the 3000-5000 nanometers or 8000-14000 nanometers 
          range. Lights and other relatively hot objects are very evident, but 
          as a result of their heat emissions, not their light emissions. 
          Collected IR imagery may then be modified in a number of ways to 
          enhance its value to the end user, such as digitally adjusting the 
          imagery to find particular anomalies and zooming in on different areas 
          of interest (see figure 1). These post-processed images can then be 
          used to prepare predictive maintenance reports on the various systems.<br>

          Using an aerial high-resolution imager, surveying a couple of 
          buildings or a mile or so of underground lines can be done by flying 
          over and locating the target(s) in the imagery, saving the data and 
          putting it together into a report. Scale information can be gathered 
          by taking off the existing CAD drawings or having someone walk over 
          the area with a tape measure. This works fine for small areas, but it 
          is not possible to make precise thermal maps of a whole complex, 
          campus, military base or city without ortho-rectification of the 
          imagery. </font>

          <br>
          In order to produce ortho-rectified thermal maps, the ultimate [most 
          useful] product, much more information must be gathered and tagged to 
          the IR imagery. During the flight, the aircraft flies straight, smooth 
          lines on a pre-planned grid, allowing 25% side lap of the imagery. The 
          IR operator manages the sensor data-acquisition (see figures 2, 3) 
          following a structured checklist for orderly data file management. The 
          imagery must be collected with a precise direct-digital timing system, 
          a 3-axis ring-laser-gyro and an inertial navigation system (INS), 
          which is tightly-coupled to a real-time differential GPS satellite 
          positioning system that provides x, y, z positioning of the aircraft 
          at all times. After imagery is collected and QC is verified, the 
          digital infrared imagery is then processed into a series of ortho-rectified 
          image tiles, which are stitched together to create a giant mosaic 
          image. An on-board computer system puts all this information together 
          using a digital elevation model (DEM) of the scene that consists of a 
          uniform grid of point elevation values and the position and 
          orientation of the camera with respect to a three-dimensional 
          coordinate system. The result is presented as a high-resolution IR 
          image in the form of a geo-TIFF, which is compatible with any GIS 
          software such as ESRI ArcView, AutoCAD 3-D Map, Global Mapper, 
          MapInfo, etc. <br>
          <br>
          Once high quality digital thermal and photographic ortho-rectified 
          maps are created, these can be added as layers to existing CAD and GIS 
          systems and to other data sets. By post-processing the imagery, many 
          wasteful conditions can be found and reported. The maps and reports 
          help facility managers keep up with their assets in a very efficient 
          manner. Below, some of the low-hanging fruit of back-end 
          post-processing of the information is discussed.</font></p>

          The farther one can get from the subject of any imaging survey, while 
          maintaining the resolution to achieve the needed image quality, the 
          more useful the data becomes. This is the aerial advantage. But, one 
          needs to obtain very high resolution imagery in order to survey large 
          areas. <br>
          <br>
          It is true that a picture is worth a thousand words; so get the big 
          picture of your facilities and start speaking volumes about its 
          condition.</font></p>
